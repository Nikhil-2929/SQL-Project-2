Alumni Career Path Analysis: Tracking Higher Studies, Employment, and Entrepreneurship Trend

This project aims to analyze the career paths of alumni from College A and College B by examining their choices in higher education, self-employment, and job placements after graduation. Alumni career trajectories are crucial for evaluating an instituteâ€™s ranking, networking opportunities, and overall success.

The dataset consists of six CSV files, categorizing alumni records based on their post-graduation choices:

âœ… Higher Studies â€“ Alumni who pursued further education.

âœ… Self-Employment â€“ Alumni who started their own businesses or ventures.

âœ… Service/Job â€“ Alumni who entered the job market.

Key Objectives:

ðŸ”¹ Compare career trends across College A and College B.

ðŸ”¹ Analyze the impact of graduation year on career choices.

ðŸ”¹ Identify the most pursued courses for higher studies.

ðŸ”¹ Evaluate the self-employment rate among alumni.

ðŸ”¹ Assess industry preferences for job-seeking alumni.

By using SQL, Excel, or visualization tools like Power BI/Tableau, this analysis will provide valuable insights into alumni success and institutional performance.
